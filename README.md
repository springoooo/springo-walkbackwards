# Installation:
Please follow the below steps to properly install this into your FiveM server:
- Download the resource by cloning it from the github repository, or simply download from the releases page.
- Extract resource files, and it is a simple drag and drop into your resources directory
- Do not forget to `ensure springo-walkbackwards` in your server.cfg
- Make sure to edit the config to your liking.

# Usage:
- Edit the base keybind from your FiveM settings. By default, holding the J key (as set in Config.BackwardModifierKey) you will be able to walk backwards in all directions. Forward movement is unaffected.
- Other features, such as ragdolling after a certain time period, and checks, can be edited in the config.lua (including anims if you know what you are doing)

# Resmon:
Standard resmon sits at 0.00 at idle and 0.01 while in use. Refer to the preview for in-action usage.
